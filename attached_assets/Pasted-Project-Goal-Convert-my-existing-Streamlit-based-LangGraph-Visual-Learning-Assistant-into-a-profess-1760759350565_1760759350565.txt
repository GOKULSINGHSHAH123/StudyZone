Project Goal: Convert my existing Streamlit-based LangGraph Visual Learning Assistant into a professional full-stack application using React (frontend) and FastAPI (backend) that demonstrates our AI-powered educational technology to investors.

Core Requirements:

Frontend (React with TypeScript):

Create a modern, responsive React dashboard with educational technology aesthetics

Implement these main sections:

Learning Dashboard - Main content generation interface (current system)

Future Features Preview - Mockups of roadmap generation and dual-agent system

Progress Analytics - Learning journey visualization

Knowledge Management - Notion integration preview

Key UI Components to Build:

Topic input with age/knowledge level selectors

Real-time progress visualization with animated workflow nodes

Parallel content streaming display with vision-analyzed images

Interactive quiz component with answer validation

Feature roadmap visualization (mockup)

Dual-agent system demo interface (partial implementation)

Backend (FastAPI):

Convert existing LangGraph workflow to FastAPI endpoints

Implement WebSocket support for real-time content streaming

Add session management for learning continuity

Create mock endpoints for future features (roadmap generation, dual-agent system)

Add basic analytics tracking

Technology Stack:

Frontend: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, React Query

Backend: FastAPI, WebSockets, LangChain, LangGraph, Gemini API

State Management: Zustand or Redux Toolkit

API Communication: Axios + WebSockets

Critical Features to Implement:

1. Current System (Full Implementation):

LangGraph workflow orchestration

Vision AI image analysis and content generation

Real-time streaming with WebSockets

Downloadable learning packages

2. Future Features (Mockups/Partial Implementation):

Roadmap Generation: Visual learning path with milestones

Dual-Agent System: Basic teaching/query agent toggle

Notion Integration: Mock sync interface

Context Preservation: Demo of uninterrupted learning flow

Visual Design Requirements:

Educational technology color scheme (blues, purples, professional gradients)

Smooth animations for workflow progression

Card-based layout for learning modules

Progress tracking visualization

Professional typography and spacing

API Endpoints to Create:

POST /api/generate-lesson - Start lesson generation

WS /ws/lesson-progress - Real-time updates

GET /api/lesson/{id} - Retrieve lesson data

POST /api/generate-roadmap - Mock roadmap generation

POST /api/ask-question - Dual-agent demo endpoint

Implementation Priority:

Phase 1: Basic React dashboard + FastAPI backend with current system

Phase 2: Real-time streaming and vision analysis

Phase 3: Future features mockups and professional polish

Phase 4: Investor demo optimizations and error handling

Success Criteria:

Professional appearance that impresses investors

Functional core LangGraph workflow

Clear demonstration of future vision

Smooth user experience with real-time feedback

Scalable architecture that suggests enterprise readiness

Additional Notes:

Use my existing Streamlit code as reference for the LangGraph workflow logic

Focus on creating a "wow factor" with smooth animations and professional UI

Include placeholder data for future features to show product vision

Ensure the demo can handle common educational topics smoothly
